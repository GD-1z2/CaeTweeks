Caemur's useless tweaks

For fabric 1.16.5

## Features
- Cool config menu (press R by default)
- Clear water/lava : makes water or lava completely transparent
- Item frame helper : shows the numbers of click required to reset an item frame's rotation.
- AntiBreak : prevents from breaking diamond/netherite/enchanted iron tools

I'll probably add more in the future
